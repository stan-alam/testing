## Artificial Intelligence Methods for Optimization of the Software Testing Process: 

```text
With Practical Examples and Exercises presents different AI-based solutions for 
overcoming the uncertainty found in many initial testing problems. The concept of 
intelligent decision making is presented as a multi-criteria, multi-objective 
undertaking. The book provides guidelines on how to manage diverse types of 
uncertainty with intelligent decision-making that can help subject matter experts 
in many industries improve various processes in a more efficient way.

As the number of required test cases for testing a product can be large (
in industry more than 10,000 test cases are usually created). 
Executing all these test cases without any particular order can impact 
the results of the test execution, hence this book fills the need for a 
comprehensive resource on the topics on the how’s, what’s and whys.

Presents one of the first empirical studies in the field, contrasting 
theoretical assumptions on innovations in a real industrial
environment with a large set of use cases from developed and developing 
testing processes at various large industries
Explores specific comparative methodologies, focusing on developed and 
developing AI-based solutions
Serves as a guideline for conducting industrial research in the artificial 
intelligence and software testing domain
Explains all proposed solutions through real industrial case studies
