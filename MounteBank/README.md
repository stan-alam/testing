## notes on Testing Microservices with MounteBank

```text
Testing Microservices with Mountebank is your guide to the ins and outs of testing
microservices with service virtualization. The book offers unique insights into
microservices application design and state-of-the-art testing practices that will
deepen your microservices skills and improve your applications.
Even if you lab test each service in isolation, it’s challenging—and potentially
dangerous—to test a live microservices system that’s changing and growing. Fortunately,
you can use Mountebank to “imitate” the components of a distributed microservices
application to give you a good approximation of the runtime conditions as you test
individual services.
Testing Microservices with Mountebank introduces the powerful practice of service
virtualization. In it, author Brandon Byars, Mountebank’s creator, offers unique
insights into microservices application design and state-of-the-art testing practices.
You’ll expand your understanding of microservices as you work with Mountebank’s
imposters, responses, behaviors, and programmability. By mastering the powerful
testing techniques in this unique book, your microservices skills will deepen
and your applications will improve.
