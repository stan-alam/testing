Get to grips with the Cypress framework and learn how to best implement end-to-end automation testing with JavaScript with the help of expert tips, best practices, and real-world testing examples

Cypress is a modern test automation framework for web-based frontend apps. Learning Cypress will help you overcome the shortcomings of conventional testing solutions such as dependency graph problems, the steep learning curve in setting up end-to-end testing packages, and difficulties in writing explicit time waits for your tests.

In End-to-End Web Testing with Cypress, you’ll learn how to use different Cypress tools, including time travel, snapshots, errors, and console output, to write fail-safe and non-flaky tests. You’ll discover techniques for performing test-driven development (TDD) with Cypress and write cross-browser tests

for your web applications. As you advance, you’ll implement tests for a sample application and work with a variety of tools and features within the Cypress ecosystem. Finally, this Cypress book will help you grasp advanced testing concepts such as visual testing and networking.

By the end of this book, you’ll have the skills you need to be able to set up Cypress for any web app and understand how to use it to its full potential.
