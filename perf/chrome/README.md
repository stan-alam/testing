## Performance Testing via Chrome-DevTools-Protocol

```text
Developer tooling within browsers is more powerful than ever, but this brings its own set of problems: there’s just so much! How does it all work? Which bits do I need? What does this even do?

When I’m auditing a site’s performance, there is a large but specific subset of DevTools that I actually care about, and I need it set up just right. This allows me to work tactically and effectively, but also opens up a whole world of possibilities that many developers aren’t even aware of.

In this video course, I’m going to show you how to set up DevTools PERFectly—as forensic, accurate, and dialled in as possible. We’ll learn how to:

Create sensible defaults
Unlock new and hidden features
Demystify existing settings
Make sense of various graphs and charts
Investigate new workflows
Loads of neat tips and tricks
And a whole host more.
The course itself won’t make you a performance expert, but it will help you to hone and refine your tooling and workflow so that you can get there a lot faster.

I think you’re gonna like this one.
