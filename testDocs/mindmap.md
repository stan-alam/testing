# Mind Mapping

## The mind map does not give you E2E tests, because mind map is based on FEATURES and USER Interactions!

To create test-cases from a mind map, decompose the branches.

Flow Charts can be derived from MindMaps

### If you need to make an E2E test, lets start with a mind map!
But why you may ask? Spreadsheets are great if you're stuck in the 1990s - 2000s.
### If you see branches lacking -- then you're lacking in test coverage!!!

**Tools**

    * MindMap

    * WhiteBoard

    * MindFree

MindMaps are based on a central idea

This is central content -- what do you want to test?

You must identify the central content of your test. There could many core functionalities of your story (acceptance testing.)

Do not branch more than 4 - 5 or 5 -6 branches of main features.

Build on each branch.

What is the software to do?

There are could be a preprocess and post processes.

MindMaps are commonly used for

    * Brainstorming

    * Problem solving

    * Note taking

    * Novel writing

    * Travel Planning

## BREAKDOWN

  * Create branches based on user features

  * Add all features as notes to the mind Mapping

  * Test ideas/cases as sub branches

  * Bird's eye view of features: where there are tests needed vs enough covered

  * Impact analysis

  * The map can be read E2E test cases by combining different branches and following through them.

**ERD** Wrap entities into objects and show how these objects are related by those attributes or entities.

When you use mindmaps you have a more visual expression of your manual tests. Drawing on relationships between objects and branches --you can generate a string **impact analysis**
This also means you do not have to sift through directories/folders.

By creating branches and e.g. one branch object may bifurcate into another branch and then even spread out to many more other branched objects.

If you had to convert ERDs for example db testing - when it's updated, min max values can be expressed richly in a mindmap vs a spreadsheet. Every object will branch off into attributes.

For Use case diagram :

Use case diagrams link entities to the actions they perform. e.g. if the app has a user based roll functionality or that gives user base provisioning. You can add users to different branch on the mindmap. e.g. the user has read only access. SO the branch will only pertain to that functionality for those roles. e.g. that particular user will not be able to update/delete. A great way to begin to decompose the mindmap to create a scenario! yay!
