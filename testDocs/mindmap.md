# Mind Mapping

### If you need to make an E2E test, lets start with a mind map!
But why you may ask? Spreadsheets are great if you're stuck in the 1990s - 2000s. 
### If you see branches lacking -- then you're lacking in test coverage!!!

**Tools**

    * Xmind

    * WiseMapping

    * MindMeister

    * MindMap

    * WhiteBoard

    * MindFree

MindMaps are based on a central idea

This is central content -- what do you want to test?

You must identify the central content of your test. There could many core functionalities of your story (acceptance testing.)

Do not branch more than 4 - 5 or 5 -6 branches of main features.

Build on each branch.

What is the software to do?

There are could be a preprocess and post processes.

MindMaps are commonly used for

    * Brainstorming

    * Problem solving

    * Note taking

    * Novel writing

    * Travel Planning

## BREAKDOWN

  * Create branches based on user features

  * Add all features as notes to the mind Mapping

  * Test ideas/cases as sub branches

  * Bird's eye view of features: where there are tests needed vs enough covered

  * Impact analysis

  * The map can be read E2E test cases by combining different branches and following through them.
