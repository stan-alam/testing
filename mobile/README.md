## Notes on Mobile testing

```text
Today, mobile apps must meet rigorous standards of reliability, usability, security,
and performance. However, many mobile developers have limited testing experience,
and mobile platforms raise new challenges even for long-time testers. Now,
Hands-On Mobile App Testing provides the solution: an end-to-end blueprint
for thoroughly testing any iOS or Android mobile app.
Reflecting his extensive real-life experience, Daniel Knott offers practical
guidance on everything from mobile test planning to automation. He provides
expert insights on mobile-centric issues, such as testing sensor inputs,
battery usage, and hybrid apps, as well as advice on coping with device and
platform fragmentation, and more.
If you want top-quality apps as much as your users do, this guide will help
you deliver them. You’ll find it invaluable–whether you’re part of a large
development team or you are the team.
